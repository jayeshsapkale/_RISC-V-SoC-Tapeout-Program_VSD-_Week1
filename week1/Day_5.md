# Day 5 â€“ Optimization in Synthesis

## ðŸ“˜ Topics  

### 1. IF/CASE Constructs
- **IF statements**  
  - Used for **conditional logic**.  
  - Synthesis tools can optimize redundant conditions.  

- **CASE statements**  
  - Used for **multi-way branching**.  
  - Supports **full case**, **incomplete case**, **overlapping case**.  
  - Optimization depends on **completeness** and **uniqueness** of case items.  

- **Key Learnings**  
  - Incomplete IF/CASE can infer **latches** unintentionally.  
  - Overlapping cases may cause **priority encoding** behavior.  
  - Synthesis tools can optimize **constant propagation** and **redundant branches**.

### 2. For Loop and For-Generate
- **For Loop**  
  - Executes **sequential statements** during simulation.  
  - Can be used for repetitive combinational/sequential logic.  

- **For-Generate**  
  - Executes **at compile/synthesis time**.  
  - Generates **hardware instances** of repeated modules or logic.  
  - Useful for scalable designs (like buses, arrays of registers).  

- **Key Learnings**  
  - Loops reduce code repetition.  
  - For-generate ensures **structural replication** in hardware.  
  - Tools optimize loops by **unrolling** or **sharing resources**.
